### Miscellaneous

1. If running on agent, make sure the directory that stores you driver jars is mapped to the exact location stored in the web.

   Web: -lib /opt/owl/drivers/oracle/

   Agent: -lib /opt/owl/drivers/oracle/

   \[agent directory structure needs to map exactly to the web connection directory structure\]

2. Reduced sensitivity of Load Time behavior detection
3. Different locations for Explorer and Connection in blue navigation panel
4. Explorer Expands to Full Screen upon entering dataset scope tab

**Notebook API**

1. opt.source.map map is not available in Notebook api
2. Cluster restart required when adding nodes to re-initialize static app configs.
3. if opt.outlier.on = true and not using Owl Load\(\) to load dataframes, dfHist.createOrReplace\("historical"\)
4. If opt.pattern.on = true, pattern needs a date column to run \(-adddc -fpgdc OWL\_RUN\_ID or define -fpgdc as actual date column\)
5. spark.catalog.clearCache\(\) should be called to clear rdd storage \(rdd build-up can occur if not routinely clearing legacy cached rdds\)
6. LinkId should be a unique row identifier
