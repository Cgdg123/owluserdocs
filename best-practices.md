# Best Practices

### **Understanding owl activities and what the key/date columns mean for each**

* [https://docs.owl-analytics.com/dq-visuals/](https://docs.owl-analytics.com/dq-visuals/)
* Training with Owl-team Zoom/On-site support 
* Running with sample data 
* Introducing anomalies on sample data and running an owlcheck to see the anomalies.

### **Using the tool with practical scenarios**

* Having Well Defined Use Cases
  * Determine a single table \(dataset\) that you would like to scan
  * Have an expectation of what you would expect Owl to find in this dataset
  * Understand which activities would capture the expected findings
* Target internal datasets with known data issues
* Historical Comparisons:
  * If pre-cleaned data is available with data findings that have been cleaned via legacy methods such as internal rules, run these datasets and compare the results from Owl to Internal findings.
* Work with data owners to understand findings or review expected findings
