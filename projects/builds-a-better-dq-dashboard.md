# Builds a Better DQ Dashboard

* **DQ Dashboards.**  Many DQ problems result from improper or too slow observation of Schema creep.  What is not caught by handmade visual inspection or the accompanying man-made rule can only be flagged by AI observation.  Conversely, what does get flagged should be easily triaged and immediately fixed with the aid of AI.  The most important metric for a DQ Dashboard is time to fix, not simply the overall DQ score.
