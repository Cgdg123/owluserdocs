Navigate to the Rule page as shown in the screenshot below. By selecting the ![https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/EdHKN\_wQnh2JhRjtF4ueQZzi8FZiWyYcCHgDsM2NsDNH8uFIdiVsoo5051CFpOTY9YbucVEZVCNrWf8VZ1EymiKc5zEKWOIheRNI25mi\_dK6mtBJwgF7yHbbtIM\_Hr3e4d\_k\_XfS](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/EdHKN_wQnh2JhRjtF4ueQZzi8FZiWyYcCHgDsM2NsDNH8uFIdiVsoo5051CFpOTY9YbucVEZVCNrWf8VZ1EymiKc5zEKWOIheRNI25mi_dK6mtBJwgF7yHbbtIM_Hr3e4d_k_XfS) icon on the top left corner under the Owl icon and select “Rule”. You will see a page as shown below. NOTE: You can get to rules from the DatasetStats page by clicking on Rules under the dataset name and score in the top right of the screen.‌

1. Select a rule type using the drop-down menu.                                                                ![Screen Shot 2019-05-03 at 1.02.30 PM.png](http://18.204.201.140:8080/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/Admin%20Guide/Rules/WebHome/Screen%20Shot%202019-05-03%20at%201.02.30%20PM.png?width=530&height=366)
2. Search for a dataset name \(that has been Owlcheck’ed - or this information will be auto-populated if coming from a DatasetStat page\). Once a dataset has been loaded the schema on the left will get populated. \(Example: begin typing in shape\_example dataset from the demo.sh script we ran earlier in this document when the dataset if found click “Load”\).

5. If applying a simple, freeform sql, or function rule type, provide a value in the condition/sql/function input field. NOTE: keystroke Ctrl+Space will provide IntelliSense.

‌The rule will be applied to the next OwlCheck run on that particular dataset.‌

#### **Rule Types** <a id="HRuleTypes"></a>

1. When to use a simple rule:
   1. Simple rules would be applied to filter a condition on a single column in a single table.
   2. Example: city = 'Baltimore'
2. When to use a freeform sql rule:
   1. ​Complex \(freeform sql\) would be used when applying a condition across multiple tables/columns and generally when more flexibility/customization is desired.
   2. ​Example: select \* from dataset where name = 'Owl'
3. When to use a preset rule:
   1. Preset rules would be used for quickly adding strict condition check. Commonly used conditions are available to add to any dataset columns.‌

All built-in spark functions are available to use. \([https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.3.0/api/sql/](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.3.0/api/sql/)\) for simple and freeform sql rules.‌

#### **Points and Percentage** <a id="HPointsandPercentage"></a>

For every percentage the X condition occurs, deduct Y points from the data quality score. If a rule was triggered 10 times out of 100 rows, break records occurred 10% of the time. If you input 1 point for every 1 percent, 10 points would be deducted from the overall score.‌

#### **Creating Your First Rule** <a id="HCreatingYourFirstRule"></a>

Let’s create a simple rule using the below information. The dataset name.

1. Search for “shape\_example” and click “Load”
2. Select “Simple Rule”
3. Rule Name = lnametest
4. @shape\_example.lname = “hootbeck” \(should hit one time day over day\).
5. Points = 1
6. Percentage = 1
7. Click “Submit”

Once the rule has been submitted please find the below list of rules with the new rule we just defined as shown below.
