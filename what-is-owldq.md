{% endhint %}

## If a user gets a wrong report because of poor DQ, what’s the impact?

The biggest issues are the things you don't anticipate and you don't immediately notice.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Billing Issue Example" %}
| "An unexpected ETL update occurred during a migration that changed our up-to-date-payments indicator from TRUE/FALSE to 1/0. Needless to say, we were very surprised when invoices were not sent. The rework and reconciliation were super painful. An enormous amount of my time was wasted." |
| :--- |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Financial Data Example" %}
| "One of our 200+ reference data feeds introduced a pipe \(\|\) into a position field. The field was defined as VARCHAR so this was allowed. Our models went crazy and we thought we breached risk limits. We ended up selling out of positions \(losing millions\). Only to uncover the root cause much later that week." |
| :--- |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="API Example" %}
| "We pull data from many APIs. One platform accounts for 10% of enrichment activities \(i.e. how we monetize our data\). Our auth token accidentally had a daily quota imposed, yet job control said green light \(successful connection\). We still loaded some rows \(1k\), just not entire payloads. This was super nuanced. We literally lost ~10% revenue that month." |
| :--- |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="IoT / Meter Example" %}
| "When we introduced new meters, they were hooked up and sending valid readings. They were valid values within valid ranges. Turned out their default setting was rounding the actual values and we were losing precision. Devastating, considering the amount of precision required with blood values." |

## Eliminate Data Quality Headaches at Scale

OwlDQ offers a low-hanging fruit opportunity to extend your data quality toolset.

The fact that data quality is a consistent pain point suggests it's important to many business-critical functions and existing products are not keeping up with the growing workload.
