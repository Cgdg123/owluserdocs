# DQ Workflows in Collibra DIC

## Benefits <a id="benefits"></a>

The DQ Workflows package listed on Collibra Marketplace allows you to 1\) create and manage Data Quality Issues, 2\) receive Notifications on Rule Metrics, and 3\) request Rule Creation and Modification within **Collibra Data Intelligence Cloud**. Data stewards will be able to organize and prioritize all requests within DIC before they take any action within **Collibra Data Quality**. 

Once deployed, the workflows will facilitate quicker data issue remediation by involving business analysts and other personas who can now participate in your data quality workstreams.

_Please note: DQ Workflows are listed on Collibra Marketplace and are templates to get customers started. Collibra-provided Marketplace listings are not subject to the same SLA obligations \(_[_https://marketplace.collibra.com/marketplace-terms/_](https://marketplace.collibra.com/marketplace-terms/)_\)  In addition, they can only be leveraged within Collibra Data Intelligence Cloud. In the future, we will work towards releasing bi-directional workflows._
